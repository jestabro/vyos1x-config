(* define the 'trim' diff_func:

   One can use the diff algorithm with this function to produce 'delete'
   commands from the sub(-tract) tree. The subtract tree contains full paths
   not present in the right hand side of the original comparison; the delete
   tree is the subtract tree with paths ending at the first subtracted node.

   Initial application of diff algorithm with function 'diff_trees':
       left, right -> added, subtracted, intersection
   Second application of diff algorithm with function 'trim_trees':
       subtracted, right -> _, delete, _

   One needs to keep the distinction of sub and delete trees: the delete
   tree is used to produce correct 'delete' commands; the sub tree contains
   complete information of the difference, used, for example, in recursively
   detecting changes at a node between the effective/session configs.

   The two trees could be produced in one pass of the diff function, but is
   an overloaded use and would gain little in optimization: the trim-ing
   walk will be on a smaller tree, only involve diff_func calls on the
   subtracted nodes, and will end at the first node not present in the
   comparison.
